# Best Practice - ASPxGridView - Online Dictionary mobile friendly web application


The idea is to create the <strong>"Online Ayurvedic Dictionary" </strong>web application with the search feature (i.e. quick filtering) for finding required ayurvedic term(s). The web site should be responsive and applicable for both Mobile and Desktop end-users. This sample demonstrates the use of DevExpress <a href="https://demos.devexpress.com/aspxgridviewdemos/">ASP.NET GridView</a> with the built-in Search feature.
